# Weekly Coding Challenges Practice

Welcome to my personal repository for tracking weekly coding challenges! I use this space to practice problem-solving, implement solutions primarily in Python, and document my learning process.

## Structure

Each week's challenge resides in its own dedicated folder, named `weekN`. Inside each folder, you will typically find:

* A Python file (e.g., `challenge_name.py`) containing the solution code, often including test cases.
* A `README.md` file detailing:
    * The problem description and examples.
    * The chosen solution approach and algorithm explanation.
    * Time and space complexity analysis.
    * Any insights gained or challenges faced during the process.

## Challenge Log

Here is a log of the challenges completed so far:
